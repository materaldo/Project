	'text1' => 'World Youth Day (WYD) is an event for young people organized by the Roman Catholic Church.
				World Youth Day was initiated by Pope John Paul II in 1985. For the first celebration of WYD 
				in 1986, bishops all over the world were invited to schedule an annual youth event to be held every 
				Palm Sunday in their dioceses. It is celebrated at the diocesan level annually, and at the international level 
				every two to three years at different locations. The 1995 World Youth Day closing Mass in the Philippines set a 
				world record for the Largest number of people gathered for a single religious event (with 5 million attendees)â€” 
				a record surpassed when 6 million attended a Mass celebrated by Pope Francis in the Philippines 20 years later in 2015.
				The Church designated Saint John Paul II and Blessed Teresa of Calcutta as the patron saints of the event.',
				
	'text2' => 'World Youth Day is commonly celebrated in a way similar to many events. The most emphasized and well known traditional theme 
				is the unity and presence of numerous different cultures. Flags and other national declarations are displayed among,
				mainly young people to show their attendance at the events and proclaim their own themes of Catholicism. Such is usually 
				done through chants and singing of other national songs involving a Catholic theme.',
				
	'text3' => 'Over the course of the major events taking place, national objects are traded between pilgrims. Flags, shirts, crosses, and 
				other Catholic icons are carried amongst pilgrims which are later traded as souvenirs to other people from different countries 
				of the world. A unity of acceptance among people is also common, with all different cultures coming together to appreciate one another.'
